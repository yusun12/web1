<h2>CSS</h2>
  <P>CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
  CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
  This tutorial will teach you CSS from basic to advanced.
  When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.
  Three Ways to Insert CSS
  There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
  External CSS
  Internal CSS
  Inline CSS
  External CSS
  With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
  Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
  Example
  External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:
</P>
</body>
</html>
